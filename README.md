# BlockchainSeries

This is a brief series of four mini projects that illustrate my understanding of blockchain technology! Each part of the code is heavily commented and was done for my Distributed Systems 1 class (CSC 435) at DePaul University. Each of these projects build on one another and are mostly done for the purpose of showing I know what I'm doing; like a Proof-of-Concept! See my portfolio entry at http://wrightdj99.github.io for more exposition on the topic. 

For now, all you have to do to see this is just download the repository and run each Java file in the terminal. The assignment was meant to be very simple in its running so that nobody would have to do any legwork with sifting through .idea or other IDE-specific files. I hope you enjoy this!
